=== Why Datamapper
Because I don't have to run migrations, and it has object identity.

=== Autotest
run it with 
$ autotest --style rspec2 

=== Database is sqlite3 in memory
It's in memory because it's really easy to work with, and fast for development.
If you work with large sets of data, change it to file.
